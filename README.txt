This game works just about exactly how the original whack-a-mole works.

-You can click on the ‘Start’ to initiate the game, but without selecting a difficulty, it defaults to the ‘hard’ difficulty.
- You can select the difficulty by using the drop down menu and then clicking on the start button.
- Time allotted per game is 10 seconds total.
Goal of game is to click (whack) as many Lokis per the time allotted.
Point is awarded per click (whack) before Loki disappears. 
You will be able to see your total score by end of game and will be cleared when clicking on the ‘Start’ again.

Main differences between the original game and the one I am submitting are the following:
-Background has been switched to ‘Asgard’.
-Music has been added, and not utilizing the mp3 file provided by the project.
-Music restarts per iteration of a game.
-Moles has been switched out to a chibi version of Loki. 
-Drop down menu has been added to select the difficulty of the game, with the project’s provided difficulty/delay.
-Changed the h1 title to whack-a-loki instead of leaving it to Whack-a-mole.
